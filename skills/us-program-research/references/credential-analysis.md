## Credential Evaluator Comparison by Program Type

| Program Type               | Primary      | Backup    | WES Product            | Notes                                |
|:---------------------------|:-------------|:---------:|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| PhD                        | WES ICAP     | ECE       | Course-by-Course       | Most PhD programs require detail     |
| Master's MS/MBA            | WES ICAP     | ECE       | Course-by-Course       | ECE if Tecnólogo borderline          |
| Second Bachelor's          | WES Basic    | WES ICAP  | Basic or C-by-C        | Confirm with each program            |

**Cost comparison:**
- WES ICAP (Course-by-Course): ~US$208 | Regular: ~7 business days | Rush: ~3 days
- ECE Standard: ~US$195 | Regular: ~7 business days | Rush: ~3 days
- Both are NACES members — broadly accepted by US universities

## WES Logistics — Step-by-Step

```
Step 1: Create account at wes.org → start WES ICAP (Course-by-Course) application
Step 2: List all institutions → receive WES Reference Number by email

Step 3: For EACH institution, request official transcripts in sealed envelope:
   - Histórico oficial with grades and credit hours
   - Diploma or graduation certificate
   - For Tecnólogo: institutional letter confirming "graduação de nível superior"
   - For FGV MBA Lato Sensu: transcript + certificate (will be evaluated as Postgraduate Certificate)

Step 4: Secretary of each institution signs/stamps OVER the sealed envelope flap

Step 5: Include WES Reference Number on a slip of paper inside each envelope
   (do NOT write on the outside of the sealed envelope)

Step 6: Candidate collects ALL sealed envelopes; combines in one outer package

Step 7: Ship via DHL or FedEx (tracked) to:
   World Education Services — Attn: Documentation Center
   64 Beaver Street, Suite 510, New York, NY 10004 — USA
   Estimated shipping from Brazil: R$300–400, 5–7 business days
   Keep DHL/FedEx tracking number

Step 8: Monitor at wes.org — WES sends email notifications:
   - Upon receipt of documents
   - Upon completion of evaluation
   Regular processing: ~7 business days after receipt
   Rush processing: ~3 business days (additional fee ~US$100)
```

### Result Scenarios:

**Scenario A — Favorable (Tecnólogo = Bachelor's):**
Proceed normally. Use WES ICAP result as primary credential document for all applications.

**Scenario B — Unfavorable (Tecnólogo = Associate's):**
1. Request ECE evaluation as second opinion (ECE sometimes evaluates more favorably)
2. If ECE also gives Associate's: focus on programs that explicitly accept 3-year degrees
3. Emphasize professional experience + executive education (Harvard, MIT, etc.) in applications
4. Contact admissions of each target program directly to ask about exceptions for your profile
5. Consider programs with "holistic review" that weight professional experience heavily

## Anti-Juniorization Analysis (Master's only — Director/VP/C-Level)

For Director/VP/C-Level candidates applying to Master's programs, proactively flag and warn
about the following as Group 2 (deprioritized):

### Red Flags for Executive Candidates:

| Red Flag                                          | Risk Level | Action          |
|:--------------------------------------------------|:----------:|:----------------|
| Daytime full-time cohort (must leave job)         | 🔴 High    | Group 2, warn   |
| Heavy mandatory coding (Python/R/SQL intensive)   | 🔴 High    | Flag, deprioritize |
| PyTorch, TensorFlow, deep learning mandatory      | 🔴 High    | Flag, deprioritize |
| Student age profile predominantly 22–27           | 🟡 Medium  | Flag for context |
| No evening/weekend/online options                 | 🔴 High    | Group 2         |
| Cohort profile: fresh graduates, no work exp.     | 🟡 Medium  | Flag for VP candidates |

**Warning message to include in the document:**
> ⚠️ RISCO DE JUNIORIZAÇÃO: Programas com cohort diurno integral e foco intensivo em
> programação técnica podem reclassificar um perfil VP de volta para nível júnior no mercado.
> Recomenda-se fortemente priorizar programas com formato executivo/evening que mantenham
> a percepção sênior do candidato.

## Advisor Fit Analysis (PhD Only)

### Search Queries (run in English):

```
1. site:{school}.edu faculty "{research_area}" publications
2. "{professor_name}" "{research_area}" publications 2022 2023 2024 site:scholar.google.com
3. "{professor_name}" accepting PhD students 2025 2026
4. "{professor_name}" h-index citations recent
5. "{professor_name}" Rate My Professor advisor review
```

### Assessment Criteria:

| Factor                                     | Green Flag           | Red Flag              |
|:-------------------------------------------|:---------------------|:----------------------|

| Research area alignment                    | Direct match         | Tangential → re-scope |
| Student reviews (RateMyProfessor/Reddit)   | Supportive, mentors  | Pressure, high attrition |
| Lab/research group active                  | Lab website updated  | Inactive since >2 years |

### Advisor Contact Email Template (to include in ACTION_PLAN.md):

```

## In-State Tuition Logic

### Eligibility Rules:

| Status                                    | In-State Eligible? | Notes                                     |
|:------------------------------------------|:-----------------:|:------------------------------------------|
| Green Card + 12 months domicile in state  | ✅ Yes            | Must be BEFORE enrollment date            |
| F1 visa (any duration)                    | ❌ Generally No   | Even after years of residence             |
| H1-B visa                                 | Varies by state   | Check each state law                      |
| US Citizen                                | ✅ Yes            | Must establish domicile                   |

**Impact:** Typically 40–60% discount on tuition at public universities.
**Private universities:** Flat rate regardless of residency — no benefit from Green Card.

### Calculation to include in document:

For each public university:
1. Find in-state cost per credit hour (official website)
2. Find out-of-state cost per credit hour
3. Calculate total both ways (in-state total, out-of-state total)
4. If candidate has Green Card + moving to state 12+ months before enrollment → use in-state
5. Show both in the cost comparison table with a note on eligibility
